# Project name
Estimating Seated Postures from Acoustic Signals using Python
## Overview
We perform skeletal estimation of seated postures using Python.
As inputs, the program requires a WAV file of audio signals, a CSV file containing the ground-truth posture labels for each frame, and a TXT file used for synchronization.
As output, a MOV file with the estimated skeleton is generated.
This program is an adaptation of the paper *“Listening Human Behavior: 3D Human Pose Estimation with Acoustic Signals”* to seated postures, and its overall workflow follows that of the original paper.
